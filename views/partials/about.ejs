			I see every bit of code I write as an opportunity to build something interesting, engaging, exciting and/or fun. In my opinion, a project isn't complete unless it is user-friendly, serves its intended purpose(s), and looks good while doing it. With an eye for design and a zest for solving complex problems, I strive to create seamless and responsive digital experiences.

			I started learning full-stack development after changing careers out of real estate. I’d always wanted to know how the web actually worked, and once I finally sat down and started building, I didn’t stop. Since then I’ve designed and shipped multiple working apps from scratch (frontend, backend, data layer, deployment) and I’m actively looking for opportunities to keep doing this professionally.

			I enjoy working on the frontend (TypeScript / JavaScript, React, Next.js, HTML, CSS, Tailwind) and I also build and connect the backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB with Mongoose, auth with JWT / Passport.js / bcryptjs) so features actually work and persist. I like solving real problems, not just putting together pretty demos.

			I am a people-person and look forward to working closely with clients and cross-functional teams to transform ideas into tangible, engaging digital solutions. Whether it's revamping an existing website or starting from scratch, I approach each project with enthusiasm and a commitment to delivering high-quality results. I'm always open to new challenges and eager to contribute my skills to projects that make a positive impact.

			In addition to my technical skills, I value clean and efficient code, adhering to best practices and industry standards. I believe that great code is not only functional but also easy to understand and maintain.

			Outside of code, I’m usually on the trail backpacking with my wife, hunting for something good to eat around the Portland metro area, or drinking a not-too-hot cup of hot chocolate.
